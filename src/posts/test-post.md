A wise man once said:

> The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up.
> Never surrender. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life.
> I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile.
> I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing.
> Fan luv. Eliptical talk. Wraith talk. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow.

The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It
cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat. Surround yourself with angels.
I’m up to something. Fan luv. Congratulations, you played yourself. I’m up to
something. Stay focused. Special cloth alert. In life there will be road blocks
but we will over come it. They will try to close the door on you, just open it.
The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never
surrender. Give thanks to the most high.

Wraith talk. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they
don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. We
don’t see them, we will never see them. Look at the sunset, life is amazing,
life is beautiful, life is what you make it. Bless up. I’m giving you cloth
talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. To be successful
you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. I’m up
to something.

They don’t want us to win. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. Wraith
talk. How’s business? Boomin. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see
that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. Mogul talk. You should never
complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed.
Don’t ever play yourself. Fan luv. Lion! Eliptical talk. We don’t see them, we
will never see them. Fan luv. Hammock talk come soon.

Fan luv. Eliptical talk. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle
to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion! A major key, never panic. Don’t
panic, when it gets crazy and rough, don’t panic, stay calm. They never said
winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. Eliptical talk. The
key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. Another one. Another one.
Always remember in the jungle there’s a lot of they in there, after you overcome
they, you will make it to paradise.
