Some of you may already know I've discontinued development as of the 30th of
September. If not, then surprise! I have a whole expedition to put you through
if you're interested, otherwise here's the tl;dr:

> The project no longer aligns with my interests and life goals.

Initially when writing this I wanted to quantify the entire experience, but I
realized that would probably be boring. So instead I'll start by saying where
my mind is at today and elaborate on what's lead me to this point. Then after
I'd like to summarize the major lessons I've learned throughout this project.

# My Mind

As I near the milestone of 30 years old, I find myself reflecting on where life
might take me over the next five to ten years. Staying in one place has never
been my style, I thrive on momentum and forward progress. My ambition drives me
to excel and refine my craft, fueled by an insatiable desire for growth. Yet, as
I consider this project, I realize it no longer aligns with where I am in life.

I'm feeling the opposite of growing pains, a sort of stagnation in my spirit.
It's a truly frustrating sensation when accompanied by the nostalgia of what
Rune Synergy was meant to be. I know I'm being melodramatic but I'm probably
not alone in this experience.

# What I'll do now

I'm going to pursue a formal education. I feel I've been pretty resourceful
at least this far into my life, I figure it's high time I suck it up and get a
Bachelor of Computer Science. I've got a long road ahead of me and I can't
risk getting distracted—which I do pretty easily. Luckily it's never too late.

# What lead to this?

It's been obvious to me I should have gone to school years ago, I simply chose
the seemingly more "fun" option of game development, particularly with one of
my favorite games. With that said, I've realised it was a bit of a mistake.
Rune Synergy started with the right energy: passion. I am passionate about game
development, particularly in game engines and computer graphics programming. The
project itself wasn't a mistake, but the intensity in which I dedicated myself
to it was.

It was a hobby turned obsession. I thought about it all day and all night, to
the point I even dreamt about it frequently. This relentless focus often came
at the expense of my personal life—I found myself withdrawing from friends and
family, neglecting other interests, and losing sight of balance. While it fueled
progress, it also created a tunnel vision that left little room for anything
else. I was able to make monthly posts until after July, where I experienced
the most "burnout" I ever had in my life.  I wasn't moving Rune Synergy forward
fast enough to satiate myself. It definitely felt like a toxic relationship I
kept coming back to.

In the end, it wasn't all bad. I learned that I would much rather make technical
analysis blogs with pretty visuals than work on the "concept" of Rune Synergy.
I found immense fulfillment in breaking down systems, presenting them in a
visually engaging way, and sharing insights that help others understand the
intricacies of the game's engine.

I also realized that game development within an existing framework like RuneScape
isn't fulfilling for me. It felt so restrictive and stifled any creativity. Rewriting
the client was frustrating because I had to conform to RuneScape's design, even when
much better approaches existed.

I'm glad it's over.

# What I really want

The dream is to turn Medieval Software into a tiny game studio with a small
group of talented individuals. I'm gonna need to grow a lot myself to reach the
point first though. Let’s see where I am 5-10 years from now.

In the meantime in between time: I want to learn more, develop stronger
connections, work to save some money, and pursue my passions in a more balanced
way. I'll be around.

Let's take this final moment to admire our AI generated frog.
