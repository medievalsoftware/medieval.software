It‚Äôs been roughly three weeks since the client conversion officially started,
and I‚Äôm proud to have made significant progress. In this post, I‚Äôll be
explaining my processes and also some interesting inner workings of the game
client, particularly in the rasterization techniques used, and of course, the
many issues I came across along the way.

# (Re)painting a picture

When rewriting an old game engine, it‚Äôs vital to ensure the new components
work correctly by creating tests. These tests compare the new output to
the original engine‚Äôs results, serving as a measure of functional continuity.
To achieve this, we export data, including numerical and image-based content,
from the old engine to serve as reference points. This approach allows us to
check that the upgraded engine accurately replicates the original gameplay,
facilitating early detection and rectification of deviations.

These tests will prove to be invaluable in the long run when I inevitably
do a refactorization process to simplify/enhance/optimize the engine, ensuring
that any changes do not break or affect the original appearance of the game in
any way.

I‚Äôll skip mentioning the boring primitives such as pixels, lines, and
rectangles. Let‚Äôs jump straight into the most frequently used primitives:

## Standing on the shoulders of triangles

Like most games nowadays, the triangle is the foundation of nearly everything
visual. It‚Äôs important to get these pixel-perfect for our goals. Luckily there
are only three types we need to worry about:

- Flat
- Smooth ([Gouraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouraud_shading))
- Textured

<div class="row center gap-1">
<div class="col">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/triangle-flat.png" class="sharp medium-img"/>
</div>
<div class="col">
<p>
Flat triangles are pretty boring, so we can just get them out the way.
</p>
</div>
</div>

### Smooth Triangles

<div class="row gap-1">
<div class="col-2-3">
<p>
Traditionally you would expect smooth triangles to transition between the red,
green and blue channels independently, but not in RuneScape 2.
</p>
<p>
Instead, it interpolates indexed colors pointing to a palette organized by hue,
saturation, and lightness (HSL). The way this palette is set up only allows for
interpolating along the X-axis or more specifically the <i>lightness</i>.
</p>
<p>
While this limitation restricts transitioning between two different hues or
saturations, it is more computationally efficient and simpler to implement
by only having to interpolate a single value as opposed to three.
</p>
<p>
While this data represents a 128√ó512 image, the engine will access these
pixels as a one-dimensional array indexed by a value formed by the following
statement.
</p>
<pre><code style="min-width:fit-content">{snippet}</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="col-1-3 center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/palette.png" class="sharp"/>
</div>
</div>

<details>
<summary>üí° Learn more about indexing</summary>

Indexing is the method by which we identify individual elements within a larger
data structure. In a list or array of items, for example, we use an index number
to directly access a specific item. Each item in the list or array is assigned
a unique index number, usually starting from 0 and increasing by 1 for each
subsequent element.

In the case of a two-dimensional array (such as an image), you can think of it
as a grid with rows and columns. To access a specific element or pixel, you‚Äôd
need two index numbers ‚Äì one for the row and one for the column. This is similar
to how you‚Äôd look up a cell in a spreadsheet by specifying the row number and
the column letter.

Now, let‚Äôs imagine that we want to simplify this to a one-dimensional index. The
concept of ‚Äúflattening‚Äù comes in handy here. Flattening a 2D array (or higher
dimensions) means converting it into a 1D array, essentially removing all but
one of the dimensions.

To do this with an image (which we‚Äôll assume is a 2D grid of pixels), you can
take each row of pixels and just append it to the end of the previous row.
You‚Äôre essentially creating a long line of pixels, which can be indexed with a
single number.

For instance, if we have a 3√ó3 image (9 pixels total), we can index it in 2D as follows:

- image[0][0] is the first pixel.
- image[0][1] is the second pixel in the first row.
- image[1][0] is the first pixel in the second row.
- image[2][2] is the last pixel.

If we flatten this to a 1D array, the indexing becomes:

- image[0] is the first pixel.
- image[1] is the second pixel.
- image[3] is the first pixel in the second row
    - because it immediately follows the third pixel of the first row
- image[8] is the last pixel.

</details>

If you‚Äôre wondering where the bitshifts came from, they are essentially just
efficient multiplications.

Bitshift|Equivalent|Reasoning
-|-|-
x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 7|* 128|Each row is 128 pixels.
x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 10|* 1024|Each hue is 1024 pixels (128√ó8).

Right, so here are the triangles using the HSL values 0, 64 and 127. The left
was rendered in Java and the right in Go.


<div class="row gap-1">
<div class="col center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/smooth-java.png" class="sharp"/>
<p>Java</p>
</div>
<div class="col center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/smooth-go.png" class="sharp"/>
<p>Go</p>
</div>
</div>

While these results appear to be identical, they are in fact not. Note: the
largest error is 4 out of 255, meaning ~1.57% error worst-case scenario which is
hardly perceptible.

<div class="row center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/smooth-error.png" class="sharp large-img"/>
</div>

Upon writing this I still don‚Äôt know what exactly the difference is. I know that
the int type in Java is supposed to be the same as int32 in Go, which is what
I wrote that function to use. But there still seems to be an error in the color
stepping that I can‚Äôt isolate. To be honest, the Go result is smoother and I
don‚Äôt want to crawl down a rabbit hole, so I just consider this a non-issue and
move on.

### Textured Triangles

<div class="row gap-1">
<div class="col-2-3">
<p>
All textures are 128√ó128 and the function for textured triangles also assumes
this for efficiency. Traditional methods of texturing triangles involve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping" target="_blank">UV mapping</a>, which surprise: this version of the game doesn‚Äôt use. Instead, the
mesh data describes a plane in model space, in which the texture exists and gets
projected onto the triangle in <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Coordinate-Systems">viewspace</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="col-1-3 center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/texture.png" class="sharp medium-img"/>
</div>
</div>

The implementation is described <a href="https://www.gamers.org/dEngine/rsc/pcgpe-1.0/texture.txt">here</a>. I‚Äôm not sure what made this solution
better than simply UV mapping. My only thought is that it somehow provided
simpler/more efficient perspective-correct projections as opposed to the
traditional 1/z interpolation.

<div class="row gap-1">
<div class="col-2-3">
<p>
There‚Äôs an interesting optimization used to turn shading for textured triangles
into simple bitshifts. A texture is transformed into 4 copies of itself, each
copy darker than the previous. It looks like we‚Äôre limited to 4 shades but
there‚Äôs an additional hidden feature allowing us to have 16 total shades. From
here we‚Äôll refer to this working copy of the texture as texels.
</p>
<p>
During generation, each texel‚Äôs red and green channels have the 3 lowest
bits cleared. This effectively allows us to use binary right shifts to halve,
quarter, or eighth the value of our colors without the green channel spilling
into the blue, or the red into the green. We don‚Äôt have to clear any blue bits
since they just get chopped off when we shift right. So the cost of having 3
more levels of shade is having 3 fewer bits to represent red or green. In this
style of game, those missing bits won‚Äôt be noticed.
</p>
</div>
<div class="col-1-3 center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/texels.png" class="sharp"/>
</div>
</div>

The line of code for clearing those bits is a single operation:

```go
texels[i] = rgb & 0xF8F8FF
```

<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/bitcrush.png"/>

If you‚Äôre not familiar with binary, a single right shift is the equivalent
of dividing by 2. Looking at the diagram above you can imagine moving the RGB
channels to the right up to three times. Finally, this yields us the equivalent
of a 512√ó512 image that would look like this:

<div class="row center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/texel-shades.png" class="xlarge-img"/>
</div>

Perfect! Now we can just plug these texels into our fill triangle function and...

<div class="row center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/bad-triangle-texture.png" class="sharp xlarge-img"/>
</div>

Oops. After all of this, I forgot that my rewrite will be keeping track of the
alpha channel for future usage. Since I didn‚Äôt clear the lower bits of the alpha
channel it spilled into the red. Since alpha isn‚Äôt a part of the shading process
we can just strip it entirely.

<div class="row center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/triangle-texture.png" class="sharp xlarge-img"/>
</div>

Finally, we have all three techniques working as expected and passing their unit
tests. We can move forward onto more complex geometry safely.

## Putting them all together

I made a table for satisfying the possible triangle options and then searched
for models which fit the bill.

Mode|Opaque|Translucent
-|-|-
Flat|Skipped|Beer glass
Gouraud|Cake|Mithril Chainbody
Textured|Mithril Chainbody + Bucket|Fishing Net

<p>
<Gallery images={models}/>
</p>

These seemed like a diverse enough set of models to test. I should mention that
I chose a rather verbose way of comparing models, not just visually but data-
wise. This will be even more important later when we start manipulating the
models since we need the data to be identical.

<div class="row center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/test-model.png" class="code"/>
</div>

Additionally, it quickly became apparent I would need some way to visualize
programming errors instead of just data. I wrote a simple utility function to
complement my tests which compares two images and exports an image with a red
circle around the failing pixel.

Here‚Äôs an example of one of our test suite models failing:

<div class="col center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/test-model-fail.png"/>
<p>Java (Ground truth) and Go (Failing) respectively</p>
</div>

It took me a minute to track the problem down, but luckily I narrowed it down
to the function used to calculate the lightness of a normal for a given light.
I was casting the result to uint16, which was not a smart idea since the result
comes from a dot product whose value can be negative. Super simple fix.

```go
func normal_lightness(n Normal, ambient, contrast, x, y, z int32) int32 {
	return ambient + (x*n.X+y*n.Y+z*n.Z)/(contrast*n.W)
}
```

Fortunately, this suite of tests revealed a few oversights such as the
palette being generated off hue which was also an easy fix. Smooth sailing so
far.

# Building our Bob

The next natural progression seemed straightforward, joining models together.
This gave me an opportunity to bring in Identikits, which are used to describe
parts of a player character‚Äôs body. Here‚Äôs Bob:

<div class="row center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/bob.png" class="sharp xlarge-img"/>
</div>

The player model has complexities such as ‚Äúlayering‚Äù (aka priorities) and is an
odd enough shape to do some depth-sorted triangle testing. So I set up some more
bobs at differing pitches and generate a ground truth image to ensure identical
results.

<div class="row center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/bobs.png" class="sharp xlarge-img"/>
</div>

You might notice some floating parts. An odd artifact of the depth sorting
algorithm used in the client seems to prefer that models don‚Äôt rotate backward
away from the camera. This has to do with the way the client defines the maximum
depth range it should expect a given model to use. Looking at Bob from the side
profile you would see he‚Äôs quite narrow, which gives us a narrow depth range.
This boundary is typically only calculated once after ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù a model which
is why it‚Äôs possible to rotate a mesh outside of its boundary.

He can rotate forward because of the loop used to access depths starting at
the calculated ‚Äòmax depth‚Äô and decrementing to zero. Here‚Äôs a side profile of
the effect:

<div class="row center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/depth-clipped.png" style="filter:drop-shadow(0 0 1px black)"/>
</div>

The actual depth sorting of the engine is done by having preallocated a mapping
of depths (up to 1500) to a list of faces (up to 512) and populating them before
a model starts drawing. This is done in Java as a 2D array indexed by [depth][n]
with n being the nth face in that depth, and the resulting value is the
face_index. [Here is the implementation on GitHub](https://github.com/thedaneeffect/RuneScape-317/blob/01295ef7f90011f8c9faa696308b0e014b50b8e2/src/main/java/Model.java#L2002-L2045).

# Bob desires ITEMS!

Items were extremely simple to implement. They‚Äôre basically only configurations.
I did end up making a test to compare every single inventory icon which
pretty quickly passed‚Ä¶

<div class="row center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/item-icons.png" class="sharp small-img"/>
</div>

EXCEPT, for one thing: this seemingly stray bit of icon. The bullseye lantern
and the sapphire bullseye lantern shared the same exact problem.

<div class="row center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/item-icons-fail.png" class="sharp small-img"/>
</div>

I was troubleshooting for a day, going as far as keeping track of stack traces
for each pixel so I could pinpoint exactly what was going on. While I was in the
middle of stepping in my debugger between the Go runtime and Java, it dawned on
me‚Ä¶ The rasterizer in Java doesn‚Äôt output an alpha channel, only RGB, and when
I export the image I‚Äôm checking if a pixel value is >= 0, then set that pixel
to opaque. But this excludes perfectly black pixels, which I had incorrectly
assumed weren‚Äôt allowed to be used. My solution ended up being to set all the
pixel values to 0xAA000000 before drawing the icons and using that value to
determine if a pixel was modified or not. This worked perfectly and I had a
passing test for item icons.

Finally moving on and getting Bob some cool gear.

<div class="row center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/bob-clothed.png" class="sharp"/>
</div>

Although‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs looking a little stiff.

# Bob needs to loosen up.

Once again, the implementation of a core feature is done differently than you
would expect. Traditional methods of animating a mesh involve rigging using a
hierarchy of bones representing a skeleton and using transformation matrices for
each bone to define its orientation. RuneScape doesn‚Äôt take this approach.

Let‚Äôs start with introducing the building blocks so that terminologies make more
sense. I‚Äôve laid the following out in an order that ensures each concept builds
on the previous:

- Label
  - If you‚Äôve heard of weight painting before, the rigging process involves assigning a ‚Äúweight‚Äù of influence a bone has to any given vertex in a mesh. In RuneScape, the weight is either 0 or 1 depending on whether a Label is assigned to a given vertex or face.
- Base
  - Holds a set of Labels that this Base will influence.
  - Describes the type of transformation this Base performs. These are the available options:
    - Origin
    - Translate
    - Rotate
    - Scale
    - Alpha
- Skeleton
  - A glorified container of Bases and nothing more.
- Transform
  - Contains a list of operations, each of which describes the Base they use, along with the parameters X, Y, and Z.
- Animation
  - Contains a list of Frames, each which describes a Primary and Secondary Transform along with a Duration. Most animations will not have secondary transforms.
  - Contains other additional data related to held item overrides, render priority, etc‚Ä¶

<div class="row center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/diagram.png" class="code"/>
</div>

Finally, Bob can do something with his newfound gear. Unfortunately, he woke up
and chose violence.

<div class="row center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/bob-animated.gif" class="sharp large-img"/>
</div>

# Our world is empty without objects

Pretty much the same story as items: Objects are basically just configurations
and the most important part will be just making sure they look right! Here‚Äôs a
bunch of ‚Äúground truth‚Äù images of objects for your eyes to feast upon:

<Gallery images={objects}/>

Everything works as expected, except for some complaints about noisy textures.
It‚Äôs hardly noticeable but occasionally there will be an ENTIRE pixel missing
from the output.

<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/bush-error.png" class="sharp" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

~~Luckily I know the cause of the inconsistency‚Ä¶ and won‚Äôt be fixing it. It‚Äôs
because Java uses 32bit integers and my implementation is using 64bit. There are
some small differences and probably some performance implications, but for now,
I‚Äôm not worried about it and consider it a non-issue.~~

4 June 2023 ‚Äì It turned out to actually be something else. Holes are allowed in
a texture when it is flagged as ‚Äúmasked‚Äù and the fetched texel is zero, however,
I had glossed over the fact the original textures used a palette system and only
allowed the first color at index 0 to be masked away. Since I neglected to use
a palette (I am now) I ran into the problem of some textures with near-black
texels becoming effectively black in their generated shades.

I think I can rest soundly knowing that my texels are now truly 1:1 to the
ground truth and I‚Äôm not just going crazy just yet!

# Our world is dead without inhabitants

Here‚Äôs a gallery of 95 NPCs for your viewing pleasure.

<Gallery images={npcs}/>

As of writing this post, I‚Äôm getting the tests set up for NPCs. So far so good.

# Deadlines were missed

While I didn‚Äôt reach my self-imposed deadline I feel like I‚Äôve made a ton of
progress. I‚Äôm happy with how things are being laid out and still optimistic I‚Äôll
get this thing actually going. As for my milestones, I‚Äôll have to push them out
a couple of weeks until I get this client conversion completed since they are
directly dependent on having you know, a client.

<div class="row center">
<Image src="/posts/devblog-5/deadline.png"/>
</div>

I‚Äôm excited to get some in-game screenshots going. I feel like I‚Äôm so close!
Still, there are some pretty major portions of the client ahead of me, like
pretty much everything scene related. Hopefully with all the models and
rasterization looking the way it should, tying the scene together shouldn‚Äôt be
such a big ordeal‚Ä¶.right?

Here are the remaining tasks:

I‚Äôm interested to read your opinions on my posts. I‚Äôm always looking to
improve my writing skills or readability! Any and all constructive feedback
is appreciated, message me on Discord "medieval.software" or [email](mailto:dane@medieval.software) me.

There are a few things I‚Äôm aware of that I‚Äôve yet to find a solution for:

- Inconsistent graphs/diagrams
  - My diagrams are all over the place.
  - I‚Äôm thinking of using the same frontend that the Rune Synergy client will use to make interactive graphs and examples! It would be cool to let my readers in on some additional technicalities they can infer from just playing with these tools.
- A mixture of technical/non-technical information
  - Every time I make a post, my goal is to take technical topics and break them down. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôve only further mystified the explanations though!
  - If my explanations haven‚Äôt been clear enough, please reach out and leave a comment! I will definitely write a follow-up post to clarify.

As always, thanks for reading. I hope you‚Äôre as excited to see Rune Synergy as I am! Join the discord to follow along!
