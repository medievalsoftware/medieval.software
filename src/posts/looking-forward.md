I’m back home and I’ve been settled in for almost a week now. Non-stop for
months, I kept thinking about what I would do when I got back, so the plan
is clear. I’m going to be renting a dedicated office space and working on my
company Medieval Software LLC. My first “product” won’t be much of a product at
all, more of a passion project I’ve always wanted to give myself a legitimate
reason to pursue.

<center>Rune Synergy - A crowdsourced RuneScape Private Server based on RuneScape from
25 June 2005.</center>

The idea is pretty simple, I write a private backend that implements all the
core features needed for RuneScape, and then I provide access to a scriptable
frontend and enable a form of live scripting to make things fun and interesting.
Easier said than done, I'm planning on essentially rewriting the entire game
client in a different language ([Go](https://go.dev)). For more information join the community!

As of now, these are just pipe dreams in a madman’s eyes. In order to rewrite
an entire game client I have to fully understand it (or rip it and smack it
together). Luckily I’ve already spent plenty of time doing this and have also
made my work publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/thedaneeffect/RuneScape-317).
I also tinkered with [WebGL2](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/) to get an idea of what to expect.
